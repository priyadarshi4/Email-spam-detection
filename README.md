# ✉️ Email Spam Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to classify emails as **spam or not spam** based on their content. The model achieves **96% accuracy** using NLP techniques and classification algorithms.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Detects spam emails with high accuracy  
✅ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text processing  
✅ Implements multiple classification models for comparison  
✅ Evaluates model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) 📝  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of email messages labeled as **spam (1) or not spam (0)**. Features include:  
- **Email subject & body text**  
- **Word frequency analysis**  
- **Spam-triggering keywords**  

## 🔬 Model Training Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing (Cleaning & Tokenization)**  
2. **Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorization)**  
3. **Model Training (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)**  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
5. **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)**  

## 📌 Results  
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on test data  
- Best-performing model: **Multinomial Naïve Bayes**  
- High precision and recall scores indicate effective spam detection
